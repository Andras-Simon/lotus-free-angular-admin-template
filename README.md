# Lotus Dashboard Template

Lotus UI is a free Angular 2+ admin dashboard template

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes `Node.js®` and an `npm` package manager.

#### Node.js
Angular requires `Node.js` version 8+

- To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

#### Angular CLI
Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Update to Angular 8
Angular 8 requires `Node.js` version 12.x   
Update guide - see: [https://update.angular.io](https://update.angular.io)

``` bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/Andras-Simon/lotus-free-angular-admin-template my-project
